The above code is developed for the applicatioin of IoT Home Automation Device as a part of internship work for "Heimatverse"
In this application ESP32 is selected as the node device.
The device has to be in frequent communication with the server through a connectivity of wifi and bluetooth.
Since, in real time the depending on the range the best connectivity medium (i.e. WiFi or Bluetooth) is chosen and code is developed in "PlatformIO Package of VS Code" Successfully.
For detailed algorithm understanding and output verification refer to "Final Documentation.pdf" attahced herewith the repo.
